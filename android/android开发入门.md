# 引言
Android apps are a bit different from ordinary Java applications, because they’re build around Activities and Fragments, which both have lifecycles that determine the state of the app. When learning Android it’s not about learning how to code, it’s more about understanding the way Android works. That means that you’ll spend the majority of the time learning about Activity lifecycles, Fragments, ListViews, Bundles and other important Android concepts.

Remember to start out by doing simple apps like a tip calculator or a unit conversion app. Then expand to more difficult areas like GPS or networking.
