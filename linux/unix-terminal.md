OS X's terminal runs bash, which includes readline support. Follow Glomek's advice and tell terminal to use option as meta key (or else use Esc) and then you've got a bunch of handy options:

- `Ctrl+w` deletes prev word (as does Meta+delete as mentioned), but you can also use Meta+f and Meta+b to walk forward and backwards thru words;
- `Ctrl+a` and `Ctrl+e` to beginning and end of line;
- `Ctrl+k` delete (kill) from cursor to end of line, and a bunch more.
- `Ctrl+r` search history
- `Ctrl+p` call previous command
